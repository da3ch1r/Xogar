Xogar
=====

Xogar is a game launcher that looks at your game library and randomly selects a game for you to play.

WARNING: This application has not been tested on a 32-bit operating system.

Prerequisites
=============

In order to use Xogar you need the following installed:

* Windows
* .NET 4.0
* Steam

Currently Xogar does not support non-Steam installed games.  Nor does it support non-Steam games that were added to Steam.

Currently Xogar assumes all installed games are owned/accessible by the current user.  If you share a computer you may have issues launching games.

How to Run
==========

Run the MSI file.  The application will be installed to C:\Program Files (x86)\Xogar and will have a Start Menu shortcut.  Just run XogarWinGui.exe.

If you installed version 1.2.0 and want to keep your list of third party games and playlists, copy the ThirdPartyGames.xml and Playlists.xml files from the directory you were running Xogar from into C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Xogar where [username] is your username.  Be aware that the AppData folder is hidden so you may have to manually enter it into the address box in the explorer window.
